- [ ] Expo Router for navigation.
- [ ] SQLite for local storage.
- [ ] Uses Typescript with no TS errors.
- [ ] Uses ESLint with no ESLint errors. (ideally use [React Compiler Linter](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/#enabling-the-linter))
- [ ] Uses Separation of Concerns (determine a project structure that follows this principle).
- [ ] Expo Font is used to implement [the font](./assets/fonts.zip).


### Optional items
Each optional item is worth 1 extra point.

- [ ] Use of animations (e.g. loading in UI elements).
- [ ] Dark mode support (making use of theming).
- [ ] Pok√©mon list is paginated and infinite scroll is used.
